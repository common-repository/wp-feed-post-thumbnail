## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Does the RSS feed still validate with this plugin enabled? ###

Yep, we add the proper XML namespaces for that. Everything just works as expected!

### Any way to force the plugin to always add a certain thumbnail size? ###

Yes, the plugin has two filters available for this:

	// Filters the size on media:content tag. Defaults to 'full'.
	add_filter( 'wp_feed_post_thumbnail_image_size_full', function( $size ) {
		return 'large'; // Return any registered image size.
	}, 10, 1 );

	// Filters the size on the media:thumbnail tag. Defaults to 'thumbnail'.
	add_filter( 'wp_feed_post_thumbnail_image_size_thumbnail', function( $size ) {
		return 'medium'; // Return any registered image size.
	}, 10, 1 );

### Can I change which images are shown? ###

Yes, the plugin has two filters available for this:

	// Filters the featured image attachment post object.
	add_filter( 'wp_feed_post_thumbnail_image', function( $thumbnail ) {
		return ''; // Return an empty string or another attachment post object.
	}, 10, 1 );

	// Filters the array of attachment post objects. Defaults to featured image post object if exists.
	add_filter( 'wp_feed_post_thumbnail_images', function( $images ) {
		$attachment_id = '123';
		$images[] =  get_post( $attachment_id ); // Additional attachment post object.
		return images;
	}, 10, 1 );

### Can I change the title, description or author shown with the image? ###

Yes, there is a filter for each of these things:

	// Filters the title on the media:title tag. Defaults to attachment title.
	add_filter( 'wp_feed_post_thumbnail_title', function( $title ) {
		return 'Override title'; // Return any plain text.
	}, 10, 1 );

	// Filters the text on the media:description tag. Defaults to attachment description.
	add_filter( 'wp_feed_post_thumbnail_description', function( $description ) {
		return 'Same description for all images'; // Return any plain string.
	}, 10, 1 );

	// Filters the name of the author on the media:copyright tag. Defaults to attachment author.
	add_filter( 'wp_feed_post_thumbnail_author', function( $author_name ) {
		return 'Matt'; // Return any plain string.
	}, 10, 1 );
